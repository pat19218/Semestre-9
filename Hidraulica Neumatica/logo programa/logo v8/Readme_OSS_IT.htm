  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-autospace:none'><span lang=IT
  style='font-size:8.0pt'>1.1 Per la cessione da parte nostra di prodotti
  software per la tecnica di automazione e di azionamento al licenziatario
  valgono esclusivamente queste condizioni generali. Le condizioni generali del
  licenziatario valgono solamente se noi le abbiamo espressamente approvate in
  forma scritta. Ai fini dell’entità delle condizioni di cessione del software
  sono determinanti le dichiarazioni concordi in forma scritta di entrambe le
  parti. Noi conferiamo al licenziatario i diritti di utilizzo del software (in
  seguito denominato &quot;SW&quot;) specificato nella conferma d'ordine o - se
  il licenziatario non riceve alcuna conferma d'ordine - nel Certificate of
  License oppure, se il licenziatario al posto del Certificate of License
  riceve un certificato di prodotto software, nel certificato di prodotto
  software. Il Certificate of License e il certificato di prodotto software
  sono in seguito denominati insieme &quot;CoL&quot;: Il licenziatario riceve
  il CoL con la cessione del SW e del documento di consegna. La modalità di
  cessione del SW risulta comunque direttamente dalla conferma d'ordine o dal
  numero di ordinazione del SW riportato nella conferma d'ordine correlato ai
  rispettivi dati per l'ordinazione (in seguito denominati &quot;dati
  d'ordine&quot;) del nostro catalogo valido al momento della conferma d'ordine
  e dal CoL. Se il licenziatario non riceve alcun supporto dei dati, egli è
  autorizzato a riprodurre il SW già in suo possesso nella misura necessaria
  consentita dai diritti di utilizzo conferiti. Ciò vale parimenti per la
  cessione elettronica del software (downloading). Finché in queste condizioni
  generali si fa riferimento ai dati d'ordine e al CoL, questo riferimento ha
  significato se il licenziatario non riceve alcuna conferma d'ordine. In ogni
  caso i dati riportati nei dati d'ordine sono anche riportati nel CoL.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-autospace:none'><span lang=IT
  style='font-size:8.0pt'>1.2 La documentazione relativa al SW (in seguito
  denominata &quot;documentazione&quot;) va richiesta separatamente a meno che
  dai dati d'ordine e dal CoL non risulti che questa fa parte della
  configurazione di fornitura. Se il licenziatario è autorizzato, secondo
  quanto indicato al paragrafo 1.1, alla riproduzione del software, ciò vale
  anche per la documentazione sempreché questa faccia parte della
  configurazione di fornitura.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-autospace:none'><span lang=IT
  style='font-size:8.0pt'>1.3 Se il licenziatario riceve da noi per il SW una
  License Key che permette l'abilitazione tecnica del SW (in seguito denominata
  &quot;License Key&quot;), questa va installata insieme con il SW.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-autospace:none'><span lang=IT
  style='font-size:8.0pt'>1.4 I diritti di utilizzo del SW conferiti al
  licenziatario risultano dal tipo di licenza (vedi paragrafo 2) e dal tipo di
  SW (vedi paragrafo 3). Tipo di licenza e tipo di SW risultano dai dati
  d'ordine e dal CoL. Se la cessione del SW avviene elettronicamente oppure
  mediante conferimento di diritti di riproduzione, i diritti e gli obblighi
  definiti in queste &quot;Condizioni generali&quot; si riferiscono alle copie
  legalmente prodotte.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-autospace:none'><span lang=IT
  style='font-size:8.0pt'>1.5 Se il licenziatario è regolarmente in possesso di
  una versione/release del SW precedente (in seguito denominata &quot;versione
  precedente&quot;), egli ha facoltà di esercitare i diritti di utilizzo a
  scelta o del SW attuale o - finché tecnicamente possibile - della versione
  precedente (downgrading). Se il SW è un Upgrade o un PowerPack secondo il
  paragrafo 4, vale inoltre quanto indicato in questo paragrafo.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-autospace:none'><span lang=IT
  style='font-size:8.0pt'>1.6 Se nella rubrica &quot;Uso parallelo&quot; del
  file Leggimi del SW vengono indicate versioni precedenti, il licenziatario ha
  il dirittto di esercitare i diritti di utilizzo per il SW opzionalmente con
  le versioni precedenti indicate in una (1) istanza. Se la &quot;Type of
  use&quot; citata nei dati d'ordine e nel CoL è &quot;Installation&quot; o
  &quot;User&quot; il licenziatario può esercitare il diritto descritto
  precedentemente e simmultaneamente nelle versioni precedenti elencate in una
  istanza. In queste condizioni generali un’&quot;Istanza&quot; è o un’istanza
  in un ambiente di sistema operativo fisico, o un’istanza in un ambiente di
  sistema operativo virtuale. La possibilita di trasferire i diritti di
  utilizzo nelle versioni precedenti è concesso solo comunemente ai diritti di
  utilizzo nel SW secondo il paragrafo 5.3.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-autospace:none'><span lang=IT
  style='font-size:8.0pt'>1.7 Se dai dati d'ordine e dal CoL risulta che il
  licenziatario ha solo il supporto dei dati ma nessuna licenza, il
  licenziatario è autorizzato all'utilizzo del SW solamente se egli ottiene una
  licenza secondo il paragrafo 2. Fino all'entrata in possesso della licenza il
  licenziatario non è neppure autorizzato al trasferimento del SW a terzi.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-autospace:none'><span lang=IT
  style='font-size:8.0pt'>1.8 Se il SW contiene &quot;Open Source
  Software&quot; o software analogo di terzi (in seguito denominato
  &quot;OSS&quot;) quest'ultimo viene indicato nel file Readme_OSS del SW. Il
  licenziatario è autorizzato a utilizzare l'OSS secondo le rispettive condizioni
  di licenza valide per l'OSS. Queste sono contenute nel supporto dati con il
  quale il licenziatario riceve il SW. Le condizioni di licenza specifiche
  dell'OSS hanno priorità rispetto alle presenti condizioni generali. Se le
  condizioni di licenza dell'OSS prevedono la fornitura del codice sorgente, lo
  metteremo a disposizione su richiesta del licenziatario dietro un adeguato
  rimborso spese. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:0cm;text-autospace:none'><span lang=IT
  style='font-size:8.0pt'>1.9 Oltre a OSS, il SW può essere o contenere anche
  altri software di licenza, ossia software che non è stato sviluppato da noi
  ma che abbiamo ottenuto in licenza da terzi (in seguito denominati
  &quot;fornitori di licenza&quot;), ad es. Microsoft Licensing Inc. Se in
  questo caso il licenziatario riceve con il SW nel file Readme_OSS le
  condizioni del rispettivo fornitore, tali condizioni valgono per la
  responsabilità del fornitore di licenza verso il licenziatario. Per quanto
  concerne la nostra responsabilità verso il licenziatario valgono in ogni caso
  le presenti condizioni generali.</span></p>

Contributor Grant.<br />      Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license<br />             <br />            (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code and/or as part of a Larger Work; and<br /><br />            (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of  Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).<br /><br />            (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.<br /><br />            (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;  3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.<br /><br /><br />3. Distribution Obligations.<br /><br />      3.1. Application of License.<br />      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients&#39; rights hereunder. However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.<br /><br />      3.2. Availability of Source Code.<br />      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.<br /><br />      3.3. Description of Modifications.<br />      You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.<br /><br />      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters<br />            (a) Third Party Claims.<br />            If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party&#39;s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL&#39;&#39; which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.<br /><br />            (b) Contributor APIs.<br />            If Contributor&#39;s Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.<br />             <br />                (c)    Representations.<br />            Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor&#39;s Modifications are Contributor&#39;s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.<br /><br /><br />      3.5. Required Notices.<br />      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe recipients&#39; rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.<br /><br />      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br />      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients&#39; rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient&#39;s rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.<br /><br />      3.7. Larger Works.<br />      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.<br /><br />4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.<br /><br />      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.<br /><br />5. Application of this License.<br /><br />      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.<br /><br />6. Versions of the License.<br /><br />      6.1. New Versions.<br />      Netscape Communications Corporation (&#39;&#39;Netscape&#39;&#39;) may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.<br /><br />      6.2. Effect of New Versions.<br />      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.<br /><br />      6.3. Derivative Works.<br />      If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases &#39;&#39;Mozilla&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;MOZILLAPL&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;MOZPL&#39;&#39;, &#39;&#39;Netscape&#39;&#39;, &quot;MPL&quot;, &#39;&#39;NPL&#39;&#39; or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)<br /><br />7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br /><br />      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &quot;AS IS&#39;&#39; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.<br /><br />8. TERMINATION.<br /><br />      8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.<br /><br />      8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as &quot;Participant&quot;)  alleging that:<br /><br />      (a)  such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)  agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.<br /><br />      (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.<br /><br />      8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant&#39;s Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.<br /><br />      8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,  all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.<br /><br />9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br /><br />      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY&#39;S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br /><br />10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br /><br />      The Covered Code is a &#39;&#39;commercial item,&#39;&#39; as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &#39;&#39;commercial computer software&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;commercial computer software documentation,&#39;&#39; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.<br /><br />11. MISCELLANEOUS.<br /><br />      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.<br /><br />12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br /><br />      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.<br /><br />13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.<br /><br />      Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as Multiple-Licensed.  Multiple-Licensed means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.<br /><br /><br />EXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.<br /><br />      ``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1 (the &quot;License&quot;); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

It is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]<br />Preamble<br />The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br />This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.<br />When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br />To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<br />For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br />Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br />Also, for each distributor&#39;s protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&#39; reputations.<br />Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.<br />Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don&#39;t assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.<br />The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.<br />Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<br /><br />However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.<br />The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a &quot;work based on the libary&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.<br />Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.<br />TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br />0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br />A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br />The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)<br />&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br />Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.<br />1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.<br />You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br />2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br />a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br />b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br />c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br />d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br />(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br />3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br />Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br />This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br />4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br />If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br />5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br />However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br />When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br />If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br />Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br />6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br />You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br />a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) <br />b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.<br />c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.<br />d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br />For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<br />It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.<br />7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br />a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. <br />b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br />8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br />9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br />10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.<br />11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br />12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br />13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br />14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br />NO WARRANTY<br />15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br />16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br />END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><p style='color:white'>_________________________________________________________________________________________ <br /></p>

BY OPENING THE SOFTWARE MEDIA PACKAGE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACCESSING THE SOFTWARE ELECTRONICALLY, INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS BY SELECTING THE &quot;ACCEPT&quot; BUTTON AT THE END OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL THESE TERMS, PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED SOFTWARE TO YOUR PLACE OF PURCHASE FOR A REFUND OR, IF THE SOFTWARE IS ACCESSED ELECTRONICALLY, SELECT THE &quot;DECLINE&quot; BUTTON AT THE END OF THIS AGREEMENT. <br />1. LICENSE TO USE. Sun grants you a non-exclusive and non-transferable license for the internal use only of the accompanying software and documentation and any error corrections provided by Sun (collectively &quot;Software&quot;), by the number of users and the class of computer hardware for which the corresponding fee has been paid. <br />2. RESTRICTIONS. Software is confidential and copyrighted. Title to Software and all associated intellectual property rights is retained by Sun and/or its licensors. Except as specifically authorized in any Supplemental License Terms, you may not make copies of Software, other than a single copy of Software for archival purposes. Unless enforcement is prohibited by applicable law, you may not modify, decompile, or reverse engineer Software. You acknowledge that Software is not designed, licensed or intended for use in the design, construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility. Sun disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for such uses. No right, title or interest in or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name of Sun or its licensors is granted under this Agreement. <br />3. LIMITED WARRANTY. Sun warrants to you that for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software is provided &quot;AS IS&quot;. Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software. <br />4. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID. <br />5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose. <br />6. Termination. This Agreement is effective until terminated. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of Software. This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement. Upon Termination, you must destroy all copies of Software. <br />7. Export Regulations. All Software and technical data delivered under this Agreement are subject to US export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.

U.S. Government Restricted Rights. If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions). <br />9. Governing Law. Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply. <br />10. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement will immediately terminate. <br />11. Integration. This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during the term of this Agreement. No modification of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party. <br />JAVAHELP(TM) VERSION 2.0<br />SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS<br /><br />These supplemental license terms (&quot;Supplemental Terms&quot;) add to or modify the terms of the Binary Code License Agreement (collectively, the &quot;Agreement&quot;). Capitalized terms not defined in these Supplemental Terms shall have the same meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement. These Supplemental Terms shall supersede any inconsistent or conflicting terms in the Agreement, or in any license contained within the Software. <br />1.

License to Distribute Software. In addition to the license granted in Section 1 (Software Internal Use and Development License Grant) of these Supplemental Terms, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including but not limited to Section 4 (Java Technology Restrictions), Sun grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to reproduce and distribute the Software in binary form only, provided that you (i) distribute the Software complete and unmodified and only bundled as part of your Programs, (ii) do not distribute additional software intended to replace any component(s) of the Software, (iii) do not remove or alter any proprietary legends or notices contained in the Software, (iv) only distribute the Software subject to a license agreement that protects Sun's interests consistent with the terms contained in this Agreement, and (v) agree to defend and indemnify Sun and its licensors from and against any damages, costs, liabilities, settlement amounts and/or expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any claim, lawsuit or action by any third party that arises or results from the use or distribution of any and all Programs and/or Software. <br />3. License to Distribute Redistributables. In addition to the license granted in Section 1 (Software Internal Use and Development License Grant) of these Supplemental Terms, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including but not limited to Section 3 (Java Technology Restrictions) of these Supplemental Terms, Sun grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to reproduce and distribute those files specifically identified as redistributable in the Software &quot;README&quot; file (&quot;Redistributables&quot;) provided that: (i) you distribute the Redistributables complete and unmodified (unless otherwise specified in the applicable README file), and only bundled as part of your Programs, (ii) you do not distribute additional software intended to supersede any component(s) of the Redistributables, (iii) you do not remove or alter any proprietary legends or notices contained in or on the Redistributables, (iv) you only distribute the Redistributables pursuant to a license agreement that protects Sun's interests consistent with the terms contained in the Agreement, and (v) you agree to defend and indemnify Sun and its licensors from and against any damages, costs, liabilities, settlement amounts and/or expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any claim, lawsuit or action by any third party that arises or results from the use or distribution of any and all Programs and/or Software. <br />4. Java Technology Restrictions. You may not modify the Java Platform Interface (&quot;JPI&quot;, identified as classes contained within the &quot;java&quot; package or any subpackages of the &quot;java&quot; package), by creating additional classes within the JPI or otherwise causing the addition to or modification of the classes in the JPI. In the event that you create an additional class and associated API(s) which (i) extends the functionality of the Java platform, and (ii) is exposed to third party software developers for the purpose of developing additional software which invokes such additional API, you must promptly publish broadly an accurate specification for such API for free use by all developers. You may not create, or authorize your licensees to create, additional classes, interfaces, or subpackages that are in any way identified as &quot;java&quot;, &quot;javax&quot;, &quot;sun&quot; or similar convention as specified by Sun in any naming convention designation. <br />5.

By contrast, the GNU General Public<br />License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br />software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br />General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br />Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br />using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br />the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br />your programs, too.<br /><br />  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br />price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br />have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br />this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br />if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br />in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br /><br />  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br />anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br />These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br />distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br /><br />  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br />gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br />you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br />source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br />rights.<br /><br />  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br />(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br />distribute and/or modify the software.<br /><br />  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br />that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br />software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br />want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br />that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br />authors' reputations.<br /><br />  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br />patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br />program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br />program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br />patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br /><br />  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br />modification follow.<br /><br /><br />		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br /><br />  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br />a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br />under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,<br />refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;<br />means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br />that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br />either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br />language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br />the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br /><br />Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br />running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br />is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br />Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br />Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br /><br />  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br />source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br />conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br />copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br />notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br />and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br />along with the Program.<br /><br />You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br />you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br /><br />  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br />of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br />distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br />above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br /><br />    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br />    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br /><br />    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br />    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br />    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br />    parties under the terms of this License.<br /><br />    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br />    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br />    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br />    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br />    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br />    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br />    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br />    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br />    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br />    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br /><br /><br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br />and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br />on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br />this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br />entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br /><br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br />collective works based on the Program.<br /><br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br />with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br />a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br />the scope of this License.<br /><br />  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br />under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br />Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br /><br />    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br />    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br />    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br /><br />    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br />    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br />    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br />    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br />    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br />    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br /><br />    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br />    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br />    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br />    received the program in object code or executable form with such<br />    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br /><br />The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br />making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br />code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br />associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br />control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br />special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br />anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br />form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br />operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br />itself accompanies the executable.<br /><br />If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br />access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br />access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br />distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br />compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br /><br /><br />  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br />except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br />otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br />void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br />However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br />this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br />parties remain in full compliance.<br /><br />  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br />signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br />distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br />prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br />modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br />Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br />all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br />the Program or works based on it.<br /><br />  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br />Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br />original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br />these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br />restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br />You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br />this License.<br /><br />  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br />conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br />distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br />may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br />license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br />all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br />the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br /><br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br />any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br />apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br />circumstances.<br /><br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br />integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br />implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br />generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br />through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br />to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br />impose that choice.<br /><br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br />be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br /><br /><br />  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br />certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br />original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br />may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br />those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br />countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br />the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br /><br />  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br />of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br />be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br />address new problems or concerns.<br /><br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any<br />later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br />either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br />Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br />this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br />Foundation.<br /><br />  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br />programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br />to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br />Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br />make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br />of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br />of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br /><br />			    NO WARRANTY<br /><br />  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br />FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br />OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br />PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br />OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br />MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br />TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br />PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br />REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br /><br />  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br />WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br />REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br />INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br />OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br />TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br />YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br />PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br />POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br /><br />		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /><br /><br />	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br /><br />  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br />possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br />free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br /><br />  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br />to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br />convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br />the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br /><br />    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br />    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br /><br />    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br />    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br />    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br />    (at your option) any later version.<br /><br />    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br />    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br />    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br />    GNU General Public License for more details.<br /><br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br />    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software<br />    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<br /><br /><br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br /><br />If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br />when it starts in an interactive mode:<br /><br />    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br />    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br />    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br />    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br /><br />The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br />parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may<br />be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br />mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br /><br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br />school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if<br />necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br /><br />  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br />  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br /><br />  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989<br />  Ty Coon, President of Vice<br /><br />This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br />proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br />consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br />library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General<br />Public License instead of this License.<br /><p style='color:white'>_________________________________________________________________________________________ <br /></p>

See the GNU<br /> * Lesser General Public License for more details.  <br /><br /><br /><br />GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br />Version 2.1, February 1999<br />Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br />51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br />Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br />of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br />[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts<br />as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence<br />the version number 2.1.]<br />Preamble<br />The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br />freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br />Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br />free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br />This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some<br />specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the<br />Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You<br />can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether<br />this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better<br />strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br />When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,<br />not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that<br />you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge<br />for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get<br />it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of<br />it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do<br />these things.<br />To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br />distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these<br />rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for<br />you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br />For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br />or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br />you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br />code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide<br />complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them<br />with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling<br />it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br />We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the<br />library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal<br />permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br />To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that<br />there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is<br />modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know<br />that what they have is not the original version, so that the original<br />author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be<br />introduced by others.<br />?<br />Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of<br />any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot<br />effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a<br />restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that<br />any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be<br />consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br />Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the<br />ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser<br />General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and<br />is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use<br />this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those<br />libraries into non-free programs.<br />When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using<br />a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a<br />combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary<br />General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the<br />entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General<br />Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with<br />the library.<br />We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it<br />does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General<br />Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less<br />of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages<br />are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many<br />libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain<br />special circumstances.<br />For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to<br />encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes<br />a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be<br />allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free<br />library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this<br />case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free<br />software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br />In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free<br />programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of<br />free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in<br />non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU<br />operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating<br />system.<br />Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the<br />users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is<br />linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run<br />that program using a modified version of the Library.<br />The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br />modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br />&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The<br />former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must<br />be combined with the library in order to run.<br />?<br />GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br />TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br />0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other<br />program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or<br />other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br />this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).<br />Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br />A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data<br />prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br />(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br />The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work<br />which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the<br />Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under<br />copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br />portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br />straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br />included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)<br />&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br />making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br />all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br />interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br />and installation of the library.<br />Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br />running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br />such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br />on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br />writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br />and what the program that uses the Library does.<br />1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s<br />complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br />you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br />appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br />all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br />warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br />Library.<br />You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br />and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br />fee.<br />?<br />2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br />of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br />distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br />above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br />a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br />b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br />stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br />c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br />charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br />d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br />table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br />the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br />is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br />in the event an application does not supply such function or<br />table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br />its purpose remains meaningful.<br />(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br />a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br />application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br />application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br />be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br />root function must still compute square roots.)<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br />and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br />on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br />this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br />entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br />it.<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br />collective works based on the Library.<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br />with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br />a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br />the scope of this License.<br />3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br />License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br />this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br />that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br />instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br />ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br />that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br />these notices.<br />?<br />Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br />that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br />subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br />This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br />the Library into a program that is not a library.<br />4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br />derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br />under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br />it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br />must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br />medium customarily used for software interchange.<br />If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br />from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br />source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br />distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br />compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br />5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br />Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br />linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a<br />work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br />therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br />However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library<br />creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br />contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the<br />library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br />Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br />When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file<br />that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br />derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br />Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br />linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br />threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br />If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br />structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br />functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br />file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br />work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br />Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br />Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br />distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br />Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br />whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br />?<br />6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or<br />link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a<br />work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br />under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br />modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse<br />engineering for debugging such modifications.<br />You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br />Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br />this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br />during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br />copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br />directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br />of these things:<br />a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br />machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br />changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br />Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br />with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that<br />uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the<br />user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br />executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br />that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br />Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br />to use the modified definitions.)<br />b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the<br />Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a<br />copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system,<br />rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)<br />will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if<br />the user installs one, as long as the modified version is<br />interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br />c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br />least three years, to give the same user the materials<br />specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br />than the cost of performing this distribution.<br />d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br />from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br />specified materials from the same place.<br />e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br />materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br />For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the<br />Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for<br />reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br />the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is<br />normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br />components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br />which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br />the executable.<br />It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br />restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br />accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br />use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br />distribute.<br />?<br />7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br />Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br />facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br />library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br />the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br />permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br />a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br />based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br />facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br />Sections above.<br />b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br />that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br />where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br />8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br />the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br />attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br />distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br />rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br />or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br />terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br />9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br />signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br />distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br />prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br />modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br />Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br />all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br />the Library or works based on it.<br />10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br />Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br />original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br />subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br />restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.<br />You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with<br />this License.<br />?<br />11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br />conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br />distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br />may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br />license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br />all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br />the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br />particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br />and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br />integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br />implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br />generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br />through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br />to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br />impose that choice.<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br />be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br />12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br />certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br />original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br />an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br />so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br />excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br />written in the body of this License.<br />13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br />versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.<br />Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br />but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br />&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and<br />conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br />the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br />license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br />the Free Software Foundation.<br />?<br />14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br />programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br />write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br />copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br />Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br />decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br />of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br />and reuse of software generally.<br />NO WARRANTY<br />15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br />WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br />EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br />OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br />KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br />IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br />PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br />LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br />THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br />16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br />WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br />AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br />FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br />CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br />LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br />RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br />FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br />SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br />DAMAGES.<br />END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br />?<br />How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br />If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br />possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br />everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<br />redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br />ordinary General Public License).<br />To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<br />safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br />convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br />&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br />&lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br />Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br />This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br />modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public<br />License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br />version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br />This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br />but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br />MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<br />Lesser General Public License for more details.<br />You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public<br />License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software<br />Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA<br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br />school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if<br />necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br />Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br />library `Frob&#39; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br />&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990<br />Ty Coon, President of Vice<br />That&#39;s all there is to it!<br /><p style='color:white'>_________________________________________________________________________________________ <br /></p>

(You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)<br /><br />    &quot;Freely Available&quot; means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.<br /><br />    You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.<br />    You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.<br />    You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:<br />        place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.<br />        use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.<br />        rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.<br />        make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.<br />    You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:<br />        distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.<br />        accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.<br />        accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.<br />        make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.<br />    You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.

It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.] <br />Preamble <br />The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. <br />This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. <br />When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. <br />To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. <br />For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. <br />We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. <br />To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. <br />Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. <br />Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. <br />When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. <br />We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. <br />For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. <br />In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. <br />Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. <br />The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. <br />TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION <br />0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. <br />A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. <br />The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.) <br />&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. <br />Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. <br />1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. <br />You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. <br />2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: <br />a) The modified work must itself be a software library. <br />b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. <br />c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. <br />d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. <br />(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) <br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. <br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. <br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. <br />3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. <br />Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. <br />This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. <br />4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. <br />If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. <br />5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. <br />However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. <br />When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. <br />If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) <br />Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. <br />6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. <br />You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: <br />a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) <br />b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. <br />c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. <br />d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. <br />e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. <br />For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. <br />It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. <br />7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: <br />a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. <br />b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. <br />8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. <br />9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. <br />10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. <br />11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. <br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. <br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. <br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. <br />12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. <br />13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. <br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. <br />14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. <br />NO WARRANTY <br />15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. <br />16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. <br />END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS <br />How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries <br />If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License). <br />To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.

<br />GNU Lesser General Public License<br /><br />Version 2.1, February 1999<br /><br />    Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br /><br />    [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]<br /><br />Preamble<br /><br />The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br /><br />This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.<br /><br />When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.<br /><br />To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.<br /><br />For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br /><br />We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br /><br />To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author&#39;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.<br /><br />Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.<br /><br />Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br /><br />When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.<br /><br />We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it does Less to protect the user&#39;s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br /><br />For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.<br /><br />In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.<br /><br />Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users&#39; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br /><br /><br />The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.<br />TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br /><br />0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br /><br />A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br /><br />The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)<br /><br />&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br /><br />Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.<br /><br />1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.<br /><br />You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br /><br />2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br /><br />    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br /><br />    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br /><br />    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br /><br />    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br /><br />    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)<br /><br />    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br /><br />    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br /><br />    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. <br /><br />3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br /><br />Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br /><br />This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br /><br />4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br /><br />If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br /><br />5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br /><br />However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br /><br />When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br /><br />If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br /><br />Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br /><br />6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br /><br />You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br /><br />    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)<br /><br />    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user&#39;s computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.<br /><br />    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.<br /><br />    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.<br /><br />    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br /><br />For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.<br /><br />It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.<br /><br />7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br /><br />    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.<br /><br />    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br /><br />8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br /><br />9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br /><br />10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br /><br />11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br /><br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br /><br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br /><br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br /><br />12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br /><br />13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br /><br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br /><br />14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br /><br />NO WARRANTY<br /><br />15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br /><br />16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br />END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br />How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br />If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).<br /><br />To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br /><br />    &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and an idea of what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;<br /><br />    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br /><br />    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.<br /><br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA <br /><br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br /><br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:<br /><br />    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library `Frob&#39; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br /><br />    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990<br />    Ty Coon, President of Vice<br /><br />That&#39;s all there is to it!<br /><p style='color:white'>_________________________________________________________________________________________ <br /></p>

<br />GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br />		       Version 2, June 1991<br /> Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br />    		    59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<br /> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br /> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br />[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is<br /> numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]<br />			    Preamble<br />  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br />freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br />Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change<br />free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.<br />  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some<br />specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any<br />other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for<br />your libraries, too.<br />  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br />price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br />have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br />this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br />if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br />in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br />  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br />anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br />These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if<br />you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.<br />  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis<br />or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave<br />you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source<br />code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide<br />complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them<br />with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling<br />it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.<br />  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright<br />the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal<br />permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.<br />  Also, for each distributor&#39;s protection, we want to make certain<br />that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br />library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br />want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original<br />version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on<br />the original authors&#39; reputations.<br /> <br />  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br />patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free<br />software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect<br />transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,<br />we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s<br />free use or not licensed at all.<br />  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary<br />GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This<br />license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain<br />designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary<br />one; be sure to read it in full, and don&#39;t assume that anything in it is<br />the same as in the ordinary license.<br />  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that<br />they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a<br />program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without<br />changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is<br />analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in<br />a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a<br />derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License<br />treats it as such.<br />  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General<br />Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software<br />sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We<br />concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.<br />  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the<br />users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the<br />libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to<br />permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while<br />preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free<br />libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve<br />this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards<br />changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this<br />will lead to faster development of free libraries.<br />  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br />modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a<br />&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The<br />former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only<br />works together with the library.<br />  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary<br />General Public License rather than by this special one.<br /> <br />		  GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br />   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br />  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which<br />contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized<br />party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library<br />General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).  Each licensee is<br />addressed as &quot;you&quot;.<br />  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data<br />prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs<br />(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.<br />  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work<br />which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the<br />Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under<br />copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a<br />portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated<br />straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is<br />included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)<br />  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br />making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means<br />all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated<br />interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation<br />and installation of the library.<br />  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br />covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br />running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from<br />such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based<br />on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for<br />writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does<br />and what the program that uses the Library does.<br />  <br />  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&#39;s<br />complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that<br />you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br />appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact<br />all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any<br />warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the<br />Library.<br />  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,<br />and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a<br />fee.<br /> <br />  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion<br />of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and<br />distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br />above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br />    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br />    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices<br />    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br />    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no<br />    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br />    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a<br />    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses<br />    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility<br />    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,<br />    in the event an application does not supply such function or<br />    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of<br />    its purpose remains meaningful.<br />    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has<br />    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the<br />    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any<br />    application-supplied function or table used by this function must<br />    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square<br />    root function must still compute square roots.)<br />These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br />identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,<br />and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br />themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br />sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br />distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br />on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br />this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br />entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote<br />it.<br />Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br />your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br />exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br />collective works based on the Library.<br />In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library<br />with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of<br />a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br />the scope of this License.<br />  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public<br />License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do<br />this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so<br />that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,<br />instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the<br />ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify<br />that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in<br />these notices.<br /> <br />  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for<br />that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all<br />subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.<br />  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of<br />the Library into a program that is not a library.<br />  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or<br />derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form<br />under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany<br />it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which<br />must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a<br />medium customarily used for software interchange.<br />  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy<br />from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the<br />source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to<br />distribute the source code, even though third parties are not<br />compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br />  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the<br />Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or<br />linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a<br />work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and<br />therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br />  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library<br />creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it<br />contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the<br />library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.<br />Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.<br />  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file<br />that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a<br />derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.<br />Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be<br />linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The<br />threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.<br />  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data<br />structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline<br />functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object<br />file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative<br />work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the<br />Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br />  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may<br />distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.<br />Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,<br />whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.<br /> <br />  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or<br />link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a<br />work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work<br />under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit<br />modification of the work for the customer&#39;s own use and reverse<br />engineering for debugging such modifications.<br />  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the<br />Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by<br />this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work<br />during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the<br />copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference<br />directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one<br />of these things:<br />    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding<br />    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever<br />    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under<br />    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked<br />    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that<br />    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the<br />    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified<br />    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood<br />    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the<br />    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application<br />    to use the modified definitions.)<br />    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at<br />    least three years, to give the same user the materials<br />    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more<br />    than the cost of performing this distribution.<br />    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy<br />    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above<br />    specified materials from the same place.<br />    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these<br />    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br />  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the<br />Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for<br />reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,<br />the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally<br />distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major<br />components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on<br />which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies<br />the executable.<br />  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license<br />restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally<br />accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot<br />use both them and the Library together in an executable that you<br />distribute.<br /> <br />  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the<br />Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library<br />facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined<br />library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on<br />the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise<br />permitted, and provided that you do these two things:<br />    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work<br />    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library<br />    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the<br />    Sections above.<br />    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact<br />    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining<br />    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.<br />  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute<br />the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any<br />attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or<br />distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your<br />rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,<br />or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses<br />terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br />  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br />signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br />distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are<br />prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br />modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the<br />Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br />all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br />the Library or works based on it.<br />  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the<br />Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br />original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library<br />subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br />restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.<br />You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br />this License.<br /> <br />  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br />infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br />conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br />otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br />excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br />distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br />License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br />may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent<br />license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by<br />all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br />the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br />refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.<br />If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br />particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,<br />and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br />It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br />patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br />such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br />integrity of the free software distribution system which is<br />implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br />generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br />through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br />system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br />to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br />impose that choice.<br />This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br />be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br />  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in<br />certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br />original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add<br />an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,<br />so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus<br />excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if<br />written in the body of this License.<br />  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new<br />versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.<br />Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,<br />but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.<br />Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library<br />specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and<br />&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and<br />conditions either of that version or of any later version published by<br />the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a<br />license version number, you may choose any version ever published by<br />the Free Software Foundation.<br /> <br />  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free<br />programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,<br />write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is<br />copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free<br />Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our<br />decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status<br />of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing<br />and reuse of software generally.<br />			    NO WARRANTY<br />  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO<br />WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br />EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR<br />OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY<br />KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE<br />IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br />PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE<br />LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME<br />THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br />  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN<br />WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY<br />AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU<br />FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR<br />CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br />LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING<br />RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br />FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF<br />SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH<br />DAMAGES.<br />		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br /> <br />           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br />  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest<br />possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that<br />everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting<br />redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the<br />ordinary General Public License).<br />  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is<br />safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br />convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the<br />&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br />    &lt;one line to give the library&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br />    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br />    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or<br />    modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public<br />    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either<br />    version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.<br />    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br />    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br />    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU<br />    Library General Public License for more details.<br />    You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public<br />    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free<br />    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<br />Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br />You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br />school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if<br />necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br />  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the<br />  library `Frob&#39; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.<br />  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990<br />  Ty Coon, President of Vice<br />That&#39;s all there is to it!<br /><p style='color:white'>_________________________________________________________________________________________ <br /></p>
