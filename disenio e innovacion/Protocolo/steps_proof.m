% 1. Preprocessing
% Apply necessary preprocessing steps to EEG signal

% 2. Feature extraction
% Extract relevant features from preprocessed EEG signal

% 3. Feature selection (if required)
% Select a subset of relevant features

% 4. Training a machine learning model
% Train the model using labeled data

% 5. Testing and classification
% Apply the trained model to test EEG signals and obtain predicted labels

% 6. Post-processing and analysis
% Analyze predicted labels to detect the exact time of activity

% Example:
% Assuming you have a vector 'eegSignal' containing the EEG data and a trained model 'classifier'

% Preprocess the signal (e.g., band-pass filter)
preprocessedSignal = preprocess(eegSignal);

% Extract features from the preprocessed signal
features = extractFeatures(preprocessedSignal);

% If needed, select relevant features
selectedFeatures = selectFeatures(features);

% Classify the signal using the trained model
predictedLabels = classifier.predict(selectedFeatures);

% Post-processing and analysis
% Assuming preictal activity is labeled as '1', ictal activity as '2', and postictal activity as '3'
preictalIndices = find(predictedLabels == 1);
ictalIndices = find(predictedLabels == 2);
postictalIndices = find(predictedLabels == 3);

% Convert the indices to time values based on the sampling rate of the EEG signal
samplingRate = 200; % Example: 200 samples per second
preictalTimes = preictalIndices / samplingRate;
ictalTimes = ictalIndices / samplingRate;
postictalTimes = postictalIndices / samplingRate;

% Print the detected times
disp('Preictal activity times:');
disp(preictalTimes);
disp('Ictal activity times:');
disp(ictalTimes);
disp('Postictal activity times:');
disp(postictalTimes);
